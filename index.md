### Research Interests

To bridge multi-scale gaps in either the gas-solid interfacial reaction system or the process granular segregation system. 

- Gas-solid interfacial reaction
  - in competition between CO and H2 in gaseous reductions of iron oxides
  - in competition between reduction and slagging reactions at elevated temperatures
  - for Iron whisker growth

- Process granular segregation
  - in bell-less top blast furnace process
  - in sintering process
